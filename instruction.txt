 The iInitialize has been modified with a variable called windows identifier or "win "in short and a new function
called iDestroy has been created.
write iDestroy like iDestroy(win).dont forget to initialize another window after destruction using iInitialize nor you 
may have an error!...see example for details...have fun...........
